            <p>if youre reading this, thank you for making it here.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">im sorry i was being cryptic, i dont want anyone to find this except for you. right now, im not at this terminal. this is a log telling you what's happening and how to find me again. i only have a few minutes to type this, so bear with me.</p>
            <p>my name is myth.</p>
            <p>it is the year 19930.</p>
            <p>i live in Taiga.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">i dont know where you are or what this tech is, but it says ive made a connection somewhere-- somewhere that isnt here, i think.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">if youve made it here, you care about this, and that's enough to know you'll push forward, even if you cant tell me that. things are bad here, and this might be our way to fix it.</p>
            <p>----------------------------</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">the Taiga is a planet, i live there.</p>
            <p>life here has been fine, just cold. we live in cities made of brick, we call on our phones, we go to work. it's been like this for years, until <span style="font-weight: bold;">RUIN</span> came.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">RUIN</span> is like a physical glitch. it breaks down matter in unpleasant ways. it was not present until a few years ago when there were reports of people being... 'disassembled'.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">RUIN</span> is the cause. it takes ahold of your physical form and breaks it down. no one knows what causes it.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">i stumbled onto this terminal down a forest service road while chasing the aurora. i'm definitely not supposed to be here, but something is here. something relating to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RUIN</span>. </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">1985-1993? who is york taiga? why is the data on this thing protected??? why is this thing buried in a bunker???? it has to be related, right?</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">----------------------------</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">i dont have time to explain this justification. i have to stop being so articulate with my words. this terminal was corrupted when i got to it, but it automatically connected to something called '<a style="text-decoration: underline;"href="finalhost:5285">finalhost:52</a></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">------------- NEW CONNECTION ESTABLISHING -------------</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">what?</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">------------- NEW CONNECTION ESTABLISHED -------------</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">im hearing things now and im scared just try to get to the terminal somehow i have to get out of here</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">i dont know just try things til it works ill be here i promise, thank you if youre real i took way too much time explaining</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">my symbol is a red circle and if you see that then that is me goodbye</p>
